NYPD keeps the record of every collision in NYC by location and injury. This data is collected because the NYC Council passed Local Law #11 in 2011. This data is manually run every month and reviewed by the TrafficStat Unit before being posted on the NYPD website. Each record represents a collision in NYC by city, borough, precinct and cross street. This data can be used by the public to see how dangerous/safe intersections are in NYC.
